    "The preceding example uses parentheses to clarify which operation is completed first. Python first determines whether the number is between 20 and 30 (the operation within parentheses), and then it checks to see if the number is divisible by 5. Next it negates the result of the divisibility check and then finally it completes the *or* comparison. In this example the parentheses are not necessary because the `and` operation would be completed first anyway, both because it has higher precedence than `or` and because it occurs to the left of `or`. (When there are multiple operations with the same precedence they are completed left to right.) It doesn't hurt to use parentheses even if they are are not needed. They often make the expression easier to understand.\n",
