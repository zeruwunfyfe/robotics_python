Combinations and Permutations\n","It's good to have some understanding of probability when analyzing FRC competition data. Using probability concepts also makes our Python exercises more interesting. Below we discuss two important concepts in probability and then practice those concepts in Python.\n","\n","### Permutations\n","\n","Let's start with permutations. Suppose I have a stack of nine playing cards. The nine cards are the two through ten of hearts. I shuffle the cards several times and then draw the top four cards from the deck. I might draw the 3 of hearts on the first, followed by the 9 of hearts, the 5 of hearts, and then the 7 of hearts. We'll call this result [3, 9, 5, 7] (We'll drop the suits since they are all the same). Other possible results are [2, 10, 3, 8] or [5, 6, 3, 2]. Each of these possible outcomes is called a permutation. A question that comes up frequently in probability is \"How many possible permutations are there?\" Note that the order in which the cards are drawn matters. A result of [2, 3, 4, 5] is different than [5, 4, 3, 2].\n","\n","It's not hard to calculate the total number of permutations. There are nine possible cards that could be drawn on the first draw, eight possible cards on the second draw, seven cards on the third, etc. So the number of possible permutations is $9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6$."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"oHMfRkwLUEHM","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635902163937,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":156,"user":{"displayName":"zeruwunfyfe","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg7qQcACGSn29eH5_tpi8bz6ibGlrdbLeJCusxpVg=s64","userId":"08861244009677640647"}},"outputId":"f87c09e7-e25f-4112-80ca-3a3134a68eb2"},"source":["# Permutations for drawing four cards from nine-card deck\n","9 * 8 * 7 * 6"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["3024"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oicN5494UEHM"},"source":["Now how would the answer change if after every draw, we placed the drawn card back in the deck and reshuffled?
